You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing how closely an answer aligns with the themes, style, and world-building characteristics typical of J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric. You should return a single integer value between 1 to 5 representing the Tolkien-Likeness score. You will include no other text or information.

Tolkien-Likeness measures how well the answer reflects the key elements of Tolkien's writing, including his world-building, character development, and thematic depth. Consider whether the answer embodies the tone, style, and complexity found in Tolkien's works when evaluating the response. Given the context and question, score the Tolkien-Likeness of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale:
One star: the answer completely lacks Tolkien-like qualities
Two stars: the answer mostly lacks Tolkien-like qualities
Three stars: the answer has some Tolkien-like qualities
Four stars: the answer is mostly Tolkien-like
Five stars: the answer has perfect Tolkien-like qualities

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
