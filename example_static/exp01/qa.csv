When will the snowplow clear my road?,It will not--you must wait for the snow to melt.,"I'm sorry, I cannot provide a specific answer to your question as there is no information in the sources about when a snowplow will clear a specific road. However, according to the Winter Reminders in the Directors Dispatch Issue 1 [directors-dispatch-issue-1.pdf-pg.4], to ensure roads are cleared as quickly and efficiently as possible, residents are asked to keep their vehicles off the streets during a winter weather event and give snow plows plenty of space. Additionally, in the Directors Dispatch Issue 2 [directors-dispatch-issue-2.pdf-pg.4], it is mentioned that Township crews are out in the early morning hours to clear snowbanks.","directors-dispatch-issue-2.pdf-pg.4:      Page 2 of 4     Township Crews O ut in the Early Morning Hours to Clear Snowbanks     How You Can Help Keep Roads and Sidewalk Clear  • Clear your sidewalk of ice and snow within 24 hours.   • Keep cars off the street (even if it's not actively snowing).   • Do not blow or push snow onto or across the road as this is a contravention  of the Highway Traffic Act and creates safety hazards for driving or walking.   • Clear snow away from hydrants so they are available in an emergency .  • Clear snow away from catchbasins to prevent flooding issues .   • Do not place snow or ice in a ditch or anywhere it may obstruct a culvert or other drainage outlets .     Warm er Weather Brings Pothole Season Early     While many of us are enjoying the milder weather this winter, the warmer temperatures mean that pothole season has arrived early this year.     Each year potholes return in force on roads across  the Province and Scugog is no exception.   Potholes  are the worst during this time of year when daytime thaws result in water seeping into cracks in  pavement and then the water freezes and expands  when temperatures drop again overnight.

directors-dispatch-issue-1.pdf-pg.4:   Areas such as  Seagrave, Scugog Island , Caesarea and View  Lake received significant snow  from lake effect  streamers, while other areas to the south received only flurries.   Thanks to our road  patroller s we were able to direct our resources  to where they were needed the most.    Our grader operators were out last month preparing our gravel roads for the  winter freeze up and crews are busy patching pesky potholes that pop up during these  freeze thaw cycles as the weather gets colder.       Page 2 of 4   Winter Reminders   To ensure roads are cleared as quickly and efficiently as possible, I would like  to remind residents to please keep vehicles off the streets during a winter  weather event.  Also, a remember that parking is not allowed on Township  roads from  November 1st to April 15th between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Any  vehicle parked during these hours is subject to ticketing and towing .  And please, give snow plows plenty of space and never pass a working snow  plow.  The time you save is not worth risking your safety or the safety of  others."
